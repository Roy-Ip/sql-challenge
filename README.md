Monash Data Analytics Bootcamp - Module 9 Assignment 

I have uploaded the following:
  - EmployeeSQL - Table Schemata - it is the SQL file to create tables (departments, dept_emp, dept_manager, employees, salaries, titles) in the EmployeeSQL database.
  - EmployeeSQL - Queries:  it is SQL file for the queries required.
  - ERD (with details) - it is the Entity Relationship Diagram.
  - ERD (without details) - it is the Entity Relationship Diagram without showing the data type.
  - data folder - it contains all the csv data file used to imported into the tables created.
